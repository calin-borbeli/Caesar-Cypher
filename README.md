# Caesar-Cypher-Python-Essentials-2-Lab

The original Caesar cipher shifts each character by one: a becomes b, z becomes a, and so on.

Let's make it a bit harder, and allow the shifted value to come from the range 1..25 inclusive.

Moreover, let the code preserve the letters' case (lower-case letters will remain lower-case) and all non-alphabetical characters should remain untouched.

The user enters one line of text to encrypt.

The user enters a shift value (an integer number from the range 1..25)
